# Stm32-PID-Heat-Controller
The aim of this project is to create a platform for pid algorithms and general purpose experiments on ARM Cortex-M3 family.

I decided to use Nescafe Dolce Gusto Heatblock for this experimental setup. The overall inertia of the heating block is so huge and non-linear as much as possible. In addition, NTC's place is very awkward. Thus, intuitive tuning was so hard to overcome.
All in all, i have managed to set the system between +-0.5 celcius boundary.
